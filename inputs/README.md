Place input files here.  Naming convention should be as follows...

- `nn-test.txt` (sample/test data for day n zero padded)
- `nn.txt` (actual data for day n zero padded)

Examples:

- `01-test.txt` (sample/test data for day 1)
- `01.txt` (actual data for day 1)
- `25-test.txt` (sample/test data for day 25)
- `25.txt` (actual data for day 25)

I have purposely not included input files in adherence to the [Advent of Code author's wishes](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about#:~:text=Can%20I%20copy,it%20something%20similar.).
