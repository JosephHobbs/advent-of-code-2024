Place solutions here.  Naming convention should be as follows...

- `solution-nn-1.py` (solution 1 for day n zero padded)
- `solution-nn-2.py` (solution 2 for day n zero padded)

Examples:

- `solution-01-1.py` (solution 1 for day 1)
- `solution-01-2.py` (solution 2 for day 1)
- `solution-25-1.py` (solution 1 for day 25)
- `solution-25-2.py` (solution 2 for day 25)

A starting stub is included as [solution_00_0.template]. Just copy to the proper name and implement.
